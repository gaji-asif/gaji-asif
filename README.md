<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I'm a passionate and curious Software Developer with over 5 years of experience turning ideas into digital experiences that make a difference.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from small tools that solve specific problems to large applications used by thousands of people. What I enjoy most is the creative side of development‚Äîunderstanding a need, brainstorming a solution, and bringing it to life in a way that's helpful and easy to use.

I believe in continuous learning, clear communication, and building things that are not just functional, but thoughtful and impactful. Whether I‚Äôm working independently or as part of a team, I take pride in being reliable, detail-oriented, and always open to new challenges.

I‚Äôm always open to connecting with other developers, creatives, and curious minds.</p>
